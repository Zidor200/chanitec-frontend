## 1. employeesPage.tsx / orgChartPage.tsx
- **employeesPage.tsx**: Manages employee records, listing, and possibly CRUD operations for employees.
- **orgChartPage.tsx**: Displays an organizational chart, showing the hierarchy or structure of employees or departments.

## 2. QuotePage
- **QuotePage.tsx / QuotePage.scss**: Main page for creating, editing, or viewing a single quote. Contains forms for quote details, item selection, client/site selection, and total calculations.

## 3. PriceOfferPage
- **PriceOfferPage.tsx / PriceOfferPage.scss**: For generating or viewing price offers based on quotes. Shows quote summary, pricing breakdown, and options to send/export the offer.

## 4. LoginPage
- **LoginPage.tsx / LoginPage.scss**: Handles user authentication. Provides a login form for users to access the application.

## 5. ItemsPage
- **ItemsPage.tsx / ItemsPage.scss**: Manages the catalog of items/products/services that can be added to quotes. Includes item listing, search/filter, and CRUD operations.

## 6. HomePage
- **HomePage.tsx / HomePage.scss**: The landing or dashboard page after login. May show recent activity, quick links, or statistics.

## 7. HistoryPage
- **HistoryPage.tsx / HistoryPage.scss**: Displays the history of quotes. Includes advanced filtering (by client, site, date, etc.), quote versioning, and actions like viewing, deleting, or setting reminders.

## 8. ClientsPage
- **ClientsPage.tsx / ClientsPage.scss**: Manages client records and their associated sites. Includes client listing, site management, and CRUD operations for both.

## General Observations
- Each main business entity (Quote, Price Offer, Item, Client, Employee) has its own management page.
- Pages are paired with SCSS files for styling.
- The structure is modular, with each business function separated into its own directory or file.
- The application supports advanced business logic, such as quote versioning, reminders, and organizational structure.
